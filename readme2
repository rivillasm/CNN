# Image Classifier
We will be following the Create your first Image Recognition Classifier using CNN, Keras and Tensorflow backend tutorial. We will make only some small adjustments because we use Docker with a newer version of Tensorflow and Keras.

If you come across any Keras object of function that you are not 100% sure what it does you can look it up in this great Keras documentation.

Getting Started - a Dog or a Cat
The idea of this tutorial is to create a simple Dog/Cat Image classifier. This is a good starting point for image recognition.

## Agenda
* Collecting data
* Importing libraries and splitting data to train and test
* Building the network
* Data augmentation
* Training
* Testing
